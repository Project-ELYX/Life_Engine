# Life Engine
An insanely complex life & relationship dashboard because I just get pissed off when I want a feature that doesn't exist.

## Yup, This Is Hell

=== Current features:
-Includes Firebase implementation for interdevice connectivity and account creation.\
-Editable Mood Status Board
-General Homepage
-Fancy ass graphics that definitely weren't necessary
-Per-Profile thematic arrangement (fixed, non-changeable)

# TODO: Additions to the app
